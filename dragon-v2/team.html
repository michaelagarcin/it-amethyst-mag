				<h2>Upcoming Missions</h2>
				<h3>SpaceX Dragon CREW-2 Mission</h3>
				<p>SpaceX Crew-2 will be the second crewed operational flight of a Crew Dragon spacecraft, and the third overall crewed orbital flight. The mission is planned to launch on 20 April 2021. The Crew-2 mission will transport four members of the crew to the International Space Station.</p>
				<p>The Crew Dragon Endeavour (C206), will dock to the International Docking Adapter (IDA) on the Harmony module. All crew are veteran astronauts, though this will be Megan McArthur's first visit to the ISS (as her first spaceflight was a shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope). Akihiko Hoshide will serve as the second Japanese ISS commander during his stay.</p>
				<p>This is the second mission by Thomas Pesquet to the International Space Station and will be called Alpha, after Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to Earth, following the French tradition to name space missions after stars or constellations.</p>
