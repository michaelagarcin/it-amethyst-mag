    <p>This is the journey from totaled to rebuilt with my 2000 Toyota Tundra.<br>I was involved in a 5 car accident back in 2019, because of the year model of my truck and the cracked radiator and core support it was called a total loss by my insurance. Since it was my gradfathers truck and the only thing I have left of his I am attached to it and decided to rebuild it myself. These are the photos of that journey.</p>
